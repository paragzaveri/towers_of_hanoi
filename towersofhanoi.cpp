/*Main Recursive Function for moving disks onto different pegs

Takes the number of disks and each of the three pegs
as arguments.

The key to this function is the order in which the pegs are
passed into the recursive call.  Notice that b and c are switched
on the first recursive call and that a and c are switched on the 
second recursive call.

Two recursive calls for when unrecursing it will still continue
calling to finish moves with each disk.

Decrements number of disks on the way through to move smaller
disks and when unrecursing, larger disks are moved.

For three disks output is:

Moving disk 1 from peg a to peg c.
Moving disk 2 from peg a to peg b.
Moving disk 1 from peg c to peg b.
Moving disk 3 from peg a to peg c.
Moving disk 1 from peg b to peg a.
Moving disk 2 from peg b to peg c.
Moving disk 1 from peg a to peg c.

There are 2^n -1 moves necessary if n is the number of disks.

Has no return type as all printing occurs from within function.
